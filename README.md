## Usage
[Download the Axure file](https://github.com/ANGIstudio/axure-slider/raw/master/Slider.rp) and follow instructions

# Features

## Fully customisable
* min/max/default values can be set
* slider-range is automatically adjusted for size of slider and min/max values
* shape / design of slider is customisable
* shape of hint is customisable
* error messages, warnings and feedback text is easily changed

## Summation
Add as many sliders as you like: values are summed without the use of a global variable.

## Keyboard input
Users can edit the field, which changes the slider position. Plus they can use up/down arrow keys to increase/decrease values.

## Easy to use
Includes a settings-panel for the Interaction-/UX-designer. The slider does not use global variables, so it is very easy to copy/paste.

Everything is commented, so it's easy to learn the tricks I used.
